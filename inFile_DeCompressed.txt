you can stand on the top of New England: the summit of Mount Washington.
Get there on the Auto Road (self-drive or van tours)
or on the historic Cog Railway. Want to climb an easy mountain?
Near Jaffrey, Mount Monadnock is the "most climbed mountain in North America's"
with great views from the top. In the Lakes Region,
take a cruise on the M/S Mount Washington.
